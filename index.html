      <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a second-year graduate student working on my Masterâ€™s degree in Health Informatics at the University of Michigan. I became interested in the field of Health Informatics after working with the massive amounts of unstructured data stored in Electronic Medical Records and hearing about the insufficiencies in IT infrastructure that plague the healthcare industry. I hope to leverage my education to help bridge this gap and ultimately improve the quality of healthcare both globally and domestically.</p>
        <p>In my free time I like to pull myself away from the computer screen. You can find me cooking, playing guitar, hiking or just relaxing outdoors.</p>
